CODE-CHALLENGE 3.
#FLATDANGO
Flatdango is a web application that allows users to purchase movie tickets from the Flatiron Movie Theater. This project is part of the week 3 code challenge for implementing a 'mini' web application using JavaScript.

Features See the first movie's details. The number of available tickets is derived by subtracting the number of tickets_sold from the theater's capacity. A GET request is made to the endpoint /films/1 to retrieve the film data. See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page in the ul#films element when the page loads. A GET request is made to the endpoint /films to retrieve the film data. Buy a ticket for a movie. After clicking the "Buy Ticket" button, the number of available tickets decreases on the frontend. The user cannot buy a ticket if the showing is sold out (if there are 0 tickets available).


Technologies Used include: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON DB Server.
